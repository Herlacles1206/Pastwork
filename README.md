Dear Sir,

If you don't have below channels, can you communicate via email?
I hope you to pay me directly, not via Upwork.
My gmail: andreasbar951206@gmail.com

I hope this email finds you well. Can we have some external channels for communication, please?
While I am concerning on work, I sometimes miss messages from Upwork.
So I think it would be benefical for us to have one more channel.
I have Skype, Discord and Gmail.
