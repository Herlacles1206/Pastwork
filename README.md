Dear Aishwarya,
 
I hope this email finds you well. Can we have some external channels for communication, please?
While I am concerning on work, I sometimes miss messages from Upwork.
So I think it would be benefical for us to have one more channel.
I have Skype, Discord and Gmail.

Skype: live:.cid.273da8c92fc12fe7

Discord: herlacles1206

Gmail: andreasbar951206@gmail.com

Thank you.
